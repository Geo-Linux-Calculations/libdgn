Building
--------

This is a preliminary source distribution, and I have not gone to any
pains to make it easy to configure and build. To build please do the 
following:

1. Update cpl_config.h to represent your platform accurately. Generally all
that matters is to #define WORDS_BIGENDIAN on big endian platforms. The
rest can likely be ignored.

2. Build the programs. 

  % make
